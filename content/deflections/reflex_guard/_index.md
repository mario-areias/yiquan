This is a deflection technique to be used with a [45 degree footwork](../footwork/45_degrees) and hands up to protect the head. This a deflection based on the reflex, when a straight punch comes through, the defender moves both hands to the side to deflect the attack. Against a round punch, the defenders pulls back both hands and move them close to their head in order to to deflect the attack.
