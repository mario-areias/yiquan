This technique is a basic deflection. It can used from the [neutral](../../stances/neutral), [classroom](../../stances/classroom) and [hands up](../../stances/hands_up) stances.


## Footwork

This technique uses the [45 degrees footwork](../../footwork/45_degrees) forward and backward.


## Technique

This technique is used almost as a strike. It can be used in two different ways:

### Agains straight punches

When a punch comes through, the defender does a 45 degrees footwork backward, turn the hips and turn the arm (doing a circle) as in a strike hitting in the center of the attacker's arm. The hands should be open, as in [open hand](../../strikes/arm/open_hand), with the palm turning up. It's a powerful deflection and often used in combination with [horse kick](../../strikes/leg/horse) and [snake](../../strikes/arm/snake). The other hand should be up ready to defend another strike or land a punch in a combination.

### Against round punches

When a round punch comes through, the defender does a 45 degrees footwork forward and hit the arm that's about to do a round punch by striking straight on the elbow. This is usually followed by an [open hand](../../strikes/arm/open_hand) on the throat. This is a more much aggressive deflection that from the straight punch. Also, the strikes it's a straight strike different from the round strike against straight punches.
