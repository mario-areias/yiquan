This technique is a basic deflection. It can used from the [neutral](../../stances/neutral), [classroom](../../stances/classroom) and [hands up](../../stances/hands_up) stances.


## Footwork

This technique uses the [45 degrees footwork](../../footwork/45_degrees) backward.


## Technique

This technique is pretty simple and used against straight punches. When a punch comes through, the defenders defend by slapping the attacker arm and moving 45 degrees backward. The slap should be quick, aiming for the arm and doing a small circle forward to hit the arm before hits the defender. It's a short movement, the slap shouldn't go further than the opposite shoulder of the defender. The other hand should be up ready to defend another strike or land a punch in a combination.

## Tips and tricks

Slaps should absorb the energy of the attacker, ideally making the attacker to commit a lot of weight on their punch leaving them vulnerable to a counter attack. The footwork is very important otherwise the absorption part does not work properly.
