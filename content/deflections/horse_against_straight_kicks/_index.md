This technique is a deflection using [horse kick](../../strikes/leg/horse). The technique consists of raising the knee when an attacker tries a straight kick and letting the attacker to hit the defender foot. It is a techinique most useful if a defender can perceive the kick early enough to do it. Otherwise, it is a better to used a different technique such as [low earth](../low_earth).
