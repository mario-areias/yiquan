This is a technique to deflect against both [front](../../strikes/leg/front) and [groin kicks](../../strikes/leg/groin). When an attacker kicks the defenders should move back 45 degrees and hit the leg with her arm like an earth block but going down to the leg. If the timing is correct not only the attacker's leg will be in pain but also it will make him strech his leg even more. The defender then can capitalise on that and counter attack quickly. Although it is categorised as a deflection, low earth is more like a strike used when defending. Percussion is super important as well.
