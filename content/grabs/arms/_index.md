There are two type of arm grabs: Under the arms or Over the arms.

## Under the arms


### Front

When an attacker comes from the front and grabs you under the arms the defence is simple. Your hands are free and his head does not have any protection. An easy way to get rid of the attacker without too much pain or violence is just use [open hand](../../strikes/arm/open_hand). Rather than do a strike, though, just push the attacker chin forward and walk in his direction. If the situation demands a more aggressive reaction, use any quick technique to strike the attacker's head. [Snake](../../strikes/arm/snake), [straight punches](../../strikes/arm/punch) and [fire elbows](../../strikes/arm/elbows) are good examples.


### Back

When an attacker comes from the back, the technique is quite different. First, step backwards into the attacker's [center line](../../theory/lines), then quickly do three [earth elbows](../../strikes/arm/elbows) in sequence aiming to the head. The first one should be very quick and used as a distraction. The other two don't need to be as quick, but they need to have more weight so they can be a powerful attack. Then use the [sparrow hawk turn](../../footwork/sparrow_hawk_turn) to face the attacker (possibly using an [earth block](../../deflections/earth)) and keep the momentum by continuing attacking.


## Over the arms


### Front

In this scenario, the attacker has his groin unprotected. The only sensible thing to do, given your arms are lock down, is to put both first together (but not locked down) and move up and straight to hit his groin. Don't stop there, though. Keep going up, so in case the attacker releases you after the strike, your hands are in position to keeping attacking.


### Back

This technique is hard, because it requires to remain relaxed (which is hard when somebody is grabbing you). With knees unlocked, step backwards into the attacker's [center line](../../theory/lines), move the hip quickly into his dantian while getting the hands up. If done correctly this should create a small gap between the attacker and yourself. Using your fist, hit backwards aiming for the attacker's groin. Move the front leg next to the back leg and then hit the attacker's groing again while stepping backwards into his direction. Do it 3 times, then use [sparrow hawk turn](../../footwork/sparrow_hawk_turn) to face the attacker and keep the momentum going by using different combinations.
