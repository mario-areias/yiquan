There are two types of Shirt Grabs. Pull and Push.


## Pull

When an attacker is pulling you by your shirt, put the hands up quickly, go in the same direction as the attacker is pulling you up and keep attackiing.

## Push

When an attacker is pushing you, go backwards in a [45 degrees step](../../footwork/45_degrees). Lock the attacker elbows by pushing them up and do a [groin kick](../../strikes/leg/groin). From there just keep pressing with more combinations.
