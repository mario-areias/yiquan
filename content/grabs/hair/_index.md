Hair grabs can be done from any direction. From behind, from the sides or even coming from the front. The technique to defend from them is the same, though. Grab the attacker's hand in your head with a strong grip. Use quandrant stepping to move in the direction of the attacker, while holding their hand and attack as soon as possible. It is quite important to firmly lock the attacker hands so then the attacker cannot move away from you and cannot move your head around while you are attacking.
