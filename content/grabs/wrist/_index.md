Wrist Grabs can come from above or under the arms.


## Above

When an attacker gets the wrist from the top, the first thing to do is to put the fingers together and point them up. With the knees unlocked, move the hands up quickly, while moving the body weight down through the [dantian](../../theory/lines). This will get your hands free and in position do a quick counter attack.


## Under

Very similar from the previous one. But here the fingers point down, the hands go down instead of up and the movement needs to finish with percussion to add extra power. Knees unlocked as before and body weight going down as well. This will get your hands free but also not in position to attack or defend easily. First thing, after getting the hands free is to put them up in order to defende against extra attack or to counter attack quickly.
