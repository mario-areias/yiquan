This is a strike based on the animal Crane. Crane is an animal with a very good balance and good percussion as well. The movement starts by unlocking the knees, moving the arm up and down in the center line and using the wrist to strike. When striking upwards the hand should go a little above the head and when striking down the hand should go close to the [dantian](../../theory/lines).
