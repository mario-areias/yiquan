This technique starts from [classroom stance](../../../stances/classroom).

## Hand position

Very similar to the [open hand position](../openhand#hand-position), palm must be and fingers together with the thumb close to the hand to avoid any injuries on it.

## Snake

This technique consists in hit the eyes of the attacker with the point of the fingers. Because of that this technique does not use the body weight, since it can injury the fingers in the process. It needs to be really quick and is used often as a distraction and as a counter attack after a deflection.

## Possible targets

This technique is only effective when targeting the eyes.

## Tips and tricks

Very often used after a [earth block](../deflections/earth)
