This technique starts from [classroom stance](../../../stances/classroom).

## Hand position

It's important to keep the hand open and fingers straight and together (thumbs needs to be close to the other fingers as well). The technique, when applied correctly, uses the palm of the hand to cause damage.

## Open Hand

This technique is very similar to the [straight punch](../punch) technique. Both use body weight to strike as also bending the knees at the right moment. They are also very smilar on the soft then hard technique. The main difference, besides how the hand should be hit the target, is the open hand comes start from below to ends on the throat of the target.

## Possible targets

This technique is most effective when landing on the throat.

## Tips and tricks

The most important thing is to use the body weight. It's important to bend the knees at the right moment. Another good trick to remember, is the soft then hard part. It makes the punch really powerful and really quick, if done properly. Elbows need to be close to the ribs as well.
