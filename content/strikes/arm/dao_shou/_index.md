Dao Shou is an incredible versatile technique. It can be used as an offensive strike and also as a defensive strike. Dao Shou basically is a quick strike with the lateral of the hand, adding percussion and is effective when hitting the throat but also as a defence for both strike and round punches. There are two types of Dao Shou.

## Inside

Inside Dao Shous are used through the center line and are effective against [straight punches](../punch) when using [intercepting footwork](../../../footwork/intercepting_footwork). When used properly it can hit the attacker's arm while also advancing through the attacker's earth line, allowing a quick counter attack.

## Outside

Outside Dao Shous are used to hit 45 degrees, they are effective against round punches when using [intercepting footwork](../../../footwork/intercepting_footwork) and also against [straight punches](../punch) when deflecting backwards in 45 degrees. It is a good defence against round punches, in the sense, when done correctly it gives the defender a tactical advantage by stopping the attack early while enabling a quick couter attack.


## Strike

Dao Shous can also be used as a strike, aiming for the throat or neck. It is usually a good strike to be used in combinations to hit the target quickly while following with a heavier strike such as a [straight punch](../punch)
