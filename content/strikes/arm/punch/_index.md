This is the basic punch technique, it starts from [classroom stance](../../../stances/classroom).

## Fist

The hand needs to form a strong first. With fingers down and thumb close to the fingers.

## Straight Punch

The important thing here is to understand one punch is driven by weight, not by strength. If strength is being used, it's not internal martial anymore. To have a successful punch, it's necessary to drive the weight by using the knees. The knees are responsible to drive 2/3 of the body weight. Also, a punch needs to be really quick. To accomplish that, a punch needs to be soft and then hard. When moving the arm, the punch is soft and when landing on the target then it becomes hard. It needs to have percussion as well on the very end of the punch for maximum power.

It's possible to use both front and back arms to do a punch. The front punch is used most as a distraction and the back punch is where the power comes from.

## Possible targets

The primary target is the throat, but it can be used in others places as well, like the groin.

## Tips and tricks

The most important thing is to use the body weight. It's important to bend the knees at the right moment. Another good trick to remember, is the soft then hard part. It makes the punch really powerful and really quick, if done properly. Elbows need to be close to the ribs as well. Keep the other hand that's not punching up all the times, so it's possible to defend from a counter attack or punch again in a combinantion.
