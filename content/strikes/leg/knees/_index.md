Like [elbows](../arm/elbows) knees are powerful techniques to be used in closed combat, particularly, after a monkey grab. The timing is very important though, the knee should hit at the same time as the attacker goes down to maximise impact.


## Straight

This is a straight knee. Although the knee should come up high and solid it should also go forward into the attacker's earth line and dantian. Quite useful after a straight monkey grab.


## Round

This is a round knee. Similar to the straight knee, this one also applies a bit of rotation to the knee before hitting the attacker. This is particularly useful when using a monkey grab from the side.
