This technique starts from [classroom stance](../../../stances/classroom).

## Groin Kick

Same principle applies from the [straight punch](../../arm/punch) regarding body weight, soft then hard and etc. All kicks start from the light leg. Put the knee above the dantian then kick aiming for the knee. Toes up and hit with your heel like a stomp from a horse. It's important to notice it's a kick and not a push and needs percussion and momentum. Specially important to bend the knee from the leg on the ground for maximum power. Hands in form a fist when kicking.

## Combinations

Horse kick is usually used in combinations, since they are a bit more slow than punches. They're perfect for when the target is not protecting their knee or to use as quick kick after a deflection like [earth block](../../../deflection/earth).
