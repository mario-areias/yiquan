This technique starts from [classroom stance](../../../stances/classroom).

## Groin Kick

Same principle applies from the [straight punch](../../arm/punch) regarding body weight, soft then hard and etc. All kicks start from the light leg. Put the knee above the dantian then kick aiming for the groin. Toes and ankles down, the idea is to hit with your ankle or your chin not with your foot. Hands in form a fist when kicking.

## Combinations

Groin kick is usually used in combinations, since they are a bit more slow than punches. They're perfect when the target moves backwards out of reach from your punches but not that far to hit a groin kick.
