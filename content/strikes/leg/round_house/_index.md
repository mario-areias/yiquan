This technique is similar to other kick techniques in the sense the leg that kicks is the light leg. Also, the knee should come up high and the anckles should come down as the [groin kick](../groin). The aim is to hit the kidney or the knees of the attacker. This is done by turning the knees inwards and hitting the target area.
