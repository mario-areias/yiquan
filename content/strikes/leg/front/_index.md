This technique starts from [classroom stance](../../../stances/classroom).

## Front Kick

Same principle applies from the [straight punch](../../arm/punch) regarding body weight, soft then hard and etc. All kicks start from the light leg. Put the knee above the dantian then kick aiming for the attacker dantian. Toes up so the fingers are not injured. Hands in form a fist when kicking.

## Combinations

Front kick is usually used in combinations, since they are a bit more slow than punches. They're perfect when the target goes backwards, front kick is a good technique to inflict damage and reduce the gap between you and the attacker.
