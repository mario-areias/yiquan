Floor defence is very tricky. It is a terrible position to be in, so defend quickly, create some distance and get up.


## Cover

Those two covers are quite similar. Both require you to turn up and face the attacker as soon as the quick is landing. They also need to be quick and need to put the knees up and elbows down to make sure there is no gap between them. The hands are in form a fist, the arm are sideways and protecting the head.

### Scoop

When a scoop kicks comes in, you turn yourself to the attacker. Knees up, elbows touch the knees, legs and arms parallel to the floor. The ideal defence is to do that right before the kick gets close to your head. After that, move the upper body backwards and kick above the attacker's knees. If the time is right, stand up (as described below) or move to a crab position to keep defending yourself.


### Stomp

Stomp is very similar to scoop but the arms are facing up to protect against the stomp quick. But everything else is the same including the kick, crab and etc.


## Crab Stance

Crab stance consist in put be sustained by both hands and feets while facing an attacker, giving you oportunity to use kicks to both attack and defend yourself. As well as face quickly in whatever direction the attacker is coming and providing the ability to stand up quickly as well. The hands should have the fingers together and pointing forward.


## Standing Up

From the crab instance, it is quick to get up. Move one of the legs down, and lift the opposite hand. From there get up, while moving backwards to get more distance from the attacker.
