## Basics

Chair defence is a bit tricky because it is not a good situation to be attacked from. The main goal for the chair defence is to survive the first attacks and get up as soon as possible in order to counter attack properly. Awareness is super important. Choose the gunslinger seat when you need to sit down like in restaurants, for example. Gunslinger seats are the ones that can see all exits, see people coming and going. Also, the gunslinger usually has a wall behind it (or something similar) blocking people to coming from a blind spot.

In case, you think you might need to defend yourself in a chair, sit in the correct position. One leg in front and another leg back (so it helps to get up) and hands on top of the knees (so they can get up quickly). Stay alert and don't get too comfy and be ready to get up.

## Grabs

### Pull

Very similar to the [pulling grab](../../grabs/shirt/#pull), put your hands up as quick as possible, get up and move together with the attacker. His hands are busy pulling you and his head unprotected. Just attack his head repeatedly.


### Push

Again similar to the [pushing grab](../../grabs/shirt/#push), lock down his arms by pushing his elbows up, kick his groing with the front leg. Put the hand up, get up and keep attacking.


## Punches and Kicks

### Punches

For punches, it is possible to use the already know deflections such as [slap](../../deflections/slap) and [salute](../../deflections/salute). The only difference is the ability to get up right after the deflection is succeded in order to counter attack quickly.

### Kicks


#### Not Grounded chair

If the chair is not grounded, you can use the regular defences for kicks such as [horse kick](../../deflections/horse_against_straight_kicks) and [low earth](../../deflections/low_earth). Horse kicks are preferred though, since it will stop the attacker before the kicks gets too close. But both techniques are effective.

#### Grounded chair

With a grounded chair is possible to put the hands on the handles. Then push the handles down, so that will make you up and kick forward. That might be a good defence when an attacker is trying to reach you but it is not too close yet.
