Short Flat Walk starts from [neutral stance](../../stances/neutral/), it is based on how the lancers in Ancient China used to move to hit the target. In many ways it is similar to [Bamboo Stepping](../bamboo).

## Stepping forward

Move the front leg forward in a straight line and then the back leg forward as well landing the back foot together with the front foot. Repeat using the foot as the front one.
