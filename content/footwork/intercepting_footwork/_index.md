This step is used to intercept an enemy attack, usually straight and round punches. This movement should be done quick and the timing is quite important in order to be effective. As soon as the attacker starts to make a move, we move the front leg forward into the attacker's earth line. Both yiquan and [bamboo](../bamboo)  step can be used as intercepting footwork. This footwork should be in conjuction with [salute](../../deflections/salute), [slap](../../deflections/slap) or [dao shao](../../strikes/arm/dao_shao).
