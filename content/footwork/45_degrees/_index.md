This is the base footwork. Very important when doing combinations.

## Forward
Start from neutral position. Move the right leg 45 degrees forward following by the left lag as well to avoid to have the legs to be stretched. The left knee should bent a little and toes pointed to the attacker. Vice-and-versa to move the left leg 45 degrees.


## Back
Start from neutral position. Move the left leg 45 degrees back following by the right leg as well. Same as before, the legs shouldnÂ´t be stretched. The left knee should bent a little and toes pointed to the attacker. Vice-and-versa to move the left leg 45 degrees.


## Tips and tricks
The weight distribution should be 60% on the back leg and 40% on the front leg. To achieve that the back leg knee should bent a little.
