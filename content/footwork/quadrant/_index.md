This techniques starts from [classroom stance](../../stances/classroom). The goal for this technique is to be able to step to the sides while fighting. When the leg moves, it needs to protect the groing like in [bamboo stepping](../bamboo).


## Right Classroom Stance

Starting from the right classroom stance

### Step Right

Move the right knee up above [dantian](../../about/theory/lines#dantian) protecting the groin, turn the hips to the right, turn the heel from the left leg to the right and land the right leg 45 degrees from the left leg. The final position should be left classroom stance. Obviously, the hands need to move as well.

### Step Left

Move the left knee up above [dantian](../../about/theory/lines#dantian) protecting the groin, turn the hips to the left, turn the heel from the right leg to the left and land the left leg 45 degrees from the right leg. Important: the movement of the leg on this technique is wider and longer than the previous one. The final position should be right classroom stance. No hand work is needed.

### Step forward, step back

It's the same as the [bamboo stepping](../bamboo).
