This is a quick step used to cover short distances and very useful when doing combination by either doing [intercepting footwork](../intercepting_footwork) or when deflecting going backwards to attack quickly after the deflection. This footwork consists in having the feet in a 45 degrees angle, the front foot slight pointed inwards, knees unlocked while pushing with the backleg. The key here is to push with the backleg first and then move the front leg. Be careful to keep the same distance betweem both legs after landing.
