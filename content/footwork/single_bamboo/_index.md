This is similar to [Short Flak Walk](../flat_walk). Starts from [neutral stance](../../stances/neutral/) as well. It similar to walk through stones in a stream. This technique is good to walk in terrains that are not flat, have obstacles and etc


## Stepping forward

Move the front foot forward and put the back foot close together. Then move the backfoot 45 degrees forward and move the other foot close together. The repetition of this movement (backfoot moving 45 degrees and the other foot moving together) is the single bamboo.
