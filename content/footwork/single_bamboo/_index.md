This is similar to [Short Flak Walk](../flat_walk). Starts from [neutral stance](../../stances/neutral/) as well. It similar to walk through stones in a stream. This technique is good to walk in terrains that are not flat, have obstacles and etc


## Stepping forward

Move the front foot 45 degrees and then move the back foot to land right next to the front foot, very similar to [Short Flak Walk](../flat_walk). Then the back foot becomes the front foot and repeat the movement. Going 45 degrees with each leg makes you walk forward.
