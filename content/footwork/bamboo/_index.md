Bamboo stepping starts from [classroom stance](../../stances/classroom/) and it's very important to do combinations. The goal for this technique is to allow the martial artist to step forward and back while fighting.

## Stepping forward

Transfer the weight from the back leg to the front leg. Then move the back leg forward. The knee needs to come above the [dantian](../../about/theory/lines#dantian) to protect the groin, so the movement should be circular rather than straight. Land the back leg 45 degrees forward of the front leg. Heels first and toes last. Now the front leg becomes the back leg and vice and versa.

## Stepping back

Move the front leg backwards. The knee needs to come above the [dantian](../../about/theory/lines#dantian) to protect the groin, so the movement should be circular. Land the front leg 45 degrees backwards of the back leg. Heels first and toes last. Now the front leg becomes the back leg and vice and versa.

## Handwork

The hand should move together with legs, in the sense after stepping forward, the hands should follow the new legs position.
