This is a mix of [Bamboo](../bamboo) and [Single Bamboo](../single_bamboo).


## Stepping forward

Starting from [neutral stance](../../stances/neutral/) move the front leg(1) forward in a straight line, then move the back leg(2) as in a bamboo step. Protecting the groin and landing 45 degrees from the front leg(1). Now the legs have swaped now the front leg is the leg 2 and the back leg is the leg 1. Move the back leg (1) close to the front leg (2) similarly as in [Short Flat Walk](../flat_walk). Repeat the movement again
