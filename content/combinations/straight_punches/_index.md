This page describe techniques against straight punches.

## Slap and Punch

This combination is simple. First, the defenders uses a [slap technique](../../deflections/slap) then uses the arm that just deflected the punch to cover the attacker arm. This results in the attacker to be vulnerable to a [straight punch](../../strikes/arm/punch).

### Footwork

If the attacker was commited, it's possible to land this combination without any additional footwork. In case the attacker wasn't commited it will be necessary to do a [bamboo step](../../footwork/bamboo) when doing the cover in order to strike a punch.



## Salute / cover then open hand

This combinations works by using a [salute](../../deflections/salute) and cover against a straight punch. The cover should come from the opposite hand the defender is using to deflect the attack. It's important the cover should be almost as quick as the salute itself but not at the same time. After the cover is successfully applied, the attacker will be vulnerable to a quick [open hand](../../strikes/arm/open_hand) on the throat. It's possible to follow through by using a [groin kick](../../strikes/leg/groin) and a couple of punches as well.

### Footwork

If the attacker was commited, it's possible to land this combination without any additional footwork. In case the attacker wasn't commited it will be necessary to do a [bamboo step](../../footwork/bamboo) when doing the cover in order to strike a punch.


## Earth, Cover with same hand and Snake.

This combination is quite aggressive. The defenders uses an [earth block](../../deflections/earth) to defend against a strike punch, quickly after that using the same hand, it cover the attacker arm and lands a [snake strike](../../strikes/arm/snake) on the eyes. After that combination, it's most likely the attacker goes backwards, so a [front kick](../../strikes/leg/front) would be a good addition here.

### Footwork

The first part of this combination doesn't require any additional footwork. But it might be necessary to follow through with other techniques.
