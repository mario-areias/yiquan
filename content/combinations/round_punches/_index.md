This page describe techniques against round punches.

## Salute and open hand

This combinations works by using a [salute](../../deflections/salute) against a round punch, which means moving forward on [45 degrees](../../footwork/45_degrees). The idea is to block the round punch right at the beginning and at same time hitting a [open hand](../strikes/arm/open_hand) on the throat. It's a pretty agressive combination. A [horse kick](../../strikes/leg/horse) after the open hand is a very good follow up as well.

## Earth, Snake strike

This combination works by using a [earth block](../../deflections/earth) against a round punch, which means moving forward on [45 degrees](../../footwork/45_degrees). Again, the same as the previous technique, the idea to block the round punch at the beginning and at same time hitting a [open hand](../strikes/arm/open_hand) on the throat. It's a pretty agressive combination. A [horse kick](../../strikes/leg/horse) after the open hand is a very good follow up as well.
