This is a brief description of the Yi Quan lines.

## Earth line

Earth line is the line of gravity, center of the balance. Attack aiming for the Earth line are very effective. The Earth line  goes from the middle of the cranium passing through the middle of the body and finally ending up on the middle of the groin.

## Center line

The line of power, where the attacks land more powerful. It's right in front of the body. That's where most of the attacks are directed, like [straight punches](../../strikes/arm/punch) or [groin kick](../../strikes/leg/groin).

## Dantian

This is the area around the belly. It's center of the gravity where all pre birth energy is stored. All techniques passes through the dantian to get the energy stored in there. Attacks against the dantian are particularly effective as well.
