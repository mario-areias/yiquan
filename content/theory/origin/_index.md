Yiquan is a old martial art. It comes all the way through from ancient China circa 900 years ago. It's battle tested and use in combat many times during Chinese history. It's one of the most effectives kung fu styles as well.

Yiquan is an internal martial art. While the definition of the internal martial art has changed over the years, nowadays it mostly means it uses body weight rather than strength to attack. It starts soft and lands hard.

Yiquan means boxing with intention and the name holds true. Yiquan is a very aggressive style, aiming to finish a fight quickly and decisively. The style is based on the Five Elements: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire and Earth and 11 animals and 1 insect.
