Elbows are used in conjunction with the elements:\nFire It is a strike forward with the arm in a horizontal position usually to try to hit the throat. The knees make the body go forward, but it needs to be careful to don\u0026rsquo;t stretch the upper body.\nWater It is also a strike forward but the arm is in a vertical position also to aim the throat or the head in general. This one needs to be careful to not hit upwards.\nWood It is an elbow to be used when an attacker is coming from behind and is aiming at the dantian. Wood elbows are quite powerful and the main reason is because it needs to be done in a very straight move. It needs to turn the upper body a bit in order to hit the dantian, but be careful to don\u0026rsquo;t turn that much.\nEarth Backwards Elbow As an wood elbow, this one is also a movement to use when an attacker is coming from behind. Instead, it is used to hit the head rather than the dantian. It is important to turn the head and look at the attacker before use this elbow. This elbow is used as a low to high technique, in the sense, the elbows start at the low level and goes high up to the head to the attacker.\nSide Elbow This is also an earth elbow. But this is to use when an attacker is on the side. It is useful in combination with Fire Elbow, after the Fire Elbow, just move your upper body a bit to the side and hit the attacker again.\nMetal This is a high to low technique. It is a similar movement from an axe. It needs a bit of flexibility in order to execute the movement properly.\n"

There are two types of Dao Shou.\nInside Inside Dao Shous are used through the center line and are effective against straight punches when using intercepting footwork. When used properly it can hit the attacker\u0026rsquo;s arm while also advancing through the attacker\u0026rsquo;s earth line, allowing a quick counter attack.\nOutside Outside Dao Shous are used to hit 45 degrees, they are effective against round punches when using intercepting footwork and also against straight punches when deflecting backwards in 45 degrees. It is a good defence against round punches, in the sense, when done correctly it gives the defender a tactical advantage by stopping the attack early while enabling a quick couter attack.\nStrike Dao Shous can also be used as a strike, aiming for the throat or neck. It is usually a good strike to be used in combinations to hit the target quickly while following with a heavier strike such as a straight punch\n"

It starts soft and lands hard.\nYiquan means boxing with intention and the name holds true. Yiquan is a very aggressive style, aiming to finish a fight quickly and decisively.

In case the attacker wasn\u0026rsquo;t commited it will be necessary to do a bamboo step when doing the cover in order to strike a punch.\nSalute / cover then open hand This combinations works by using a salute and cover against a straight punch. The cover should come from the opposite hand the defender is using to deflect the attack. It\u0026rsquo;s important the cover should be almost as quick as the salute itself but not at the same time. After the cover is successfully applied, the attacker will be vulnerable to a quick open hand on the throat. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to follow through by using a groin kick and a couple of punches as well.\nFootwork If the attacker was commited, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to land this combination without any additional footwork. In case the attacker wasn\u0026rsquo;t commited it will be necessary to do a bamboo step when doing the cover in order to strike a punch.\nEarth, Cover with same hand and Snake. This combination is quite aggressive. The defenders uses an earth block to defend against a strike punch, quickly after that using the same hand, it cover the attacker arm and lands a snake strike on the eyes. After that combination, it\u0026rsquo;s most likely the attacker goes backwards, so a front kick would be a good addition here.\nFootwork The first part of this combination doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any additional footwork.

The hands should be open, as in open hand, with the palm turning up. It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful deflection and often used in combination with horse kick and snake. The other hand should be up ready to defend another strike or land a punch in a combination.\nAgainst round punches When a round punch comes through, the defender does a 45 degrees footwork forward and hit the arm that\u0026rsquo;s about to do a round punch by striking straight on the elbow. This is usually followed by an open hand on the throat. This is a more much aggressive deflection that from the straight punch.

More info 45 degrees footwork\nHands position If the right leg is the front leg, the right hand should be at the face level. Not too close to the face and not too far too. The hand should be open and fingers together. The left hand should be close to the dantian. And vice-versa in case the left leg is the front leg.\nTips and tricks The important point for this stance is the weight: 60% on the back leg and 40% on the front leg. Knees should bent a little so the weight is better distributed.\n"
