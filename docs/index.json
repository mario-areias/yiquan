	"content": " Floor defence is very tricky. It is a terrible position to be in, so defend quickly, create some distance and get up.\nCover Those two covers are quite similar. Both require you to turn up and face the attacker as soon as the quick is landing. They also need to be quick and need to put the knees up and elbows down to make sure there is no gap between them. The hands are in form a fist, the arm are sideways and protecting the head.\nScoop When a scoop kicks comes in, you turn yourself to the attacker. Knees up, elbows touch the knees, legs and arms parallel to the floor. The ideal defence is to do that right before the kick gets close to your head. After that, move the upper body backwards and kick above the attacker\u0026rsquo;s knees. If the time is right, stand up (as described below) or move to a crab position to keep defending yourself.\nStomp Stomp is very similar to scoop but the arms are facing up to protect against the stomp quick. But everything else is the same including the kick, crab and etc.\nCrab Stance Crab stance consist in put be sustained by both hands and feets while facing an attacker, giving you oportunity to use kicks to both attack and defend yourself. As well as face quickly in whatever direction the attacker is coming and providing the ability to stand up quickly as well. The hands should have the fingers together and pointing forward.\nStanding Up From the crab instance, it is quick to get up. Move one of the legs down, and lift the opposite hand. From there get up, while moving backwards to get more distance from the attacker.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " Basics Chair defence is a bit tricky because it is not a good situation to be attacked from. The main goal for the chair defence is to survive the first attacks and get up as soon as possible in order to counter attack properly. Awareness is super important. Choose the gunslinger seat when you need to sit down like in restaurants, for example. Gunslinger seats are the ones that can see all exits, see people coming and going. Also, the gunslinger usually has a wall behind it (or something similar) blocking people to coming from a blind spot.\nIn case, you think you might need to defend yourself in a chair, sit in the correct position. One leg in front and another leg back (so it helps to get up) and hands on top of the knees (so they can get up quickly). Stay alert and don\u0026rsquo;t get too comfy and be ready to get up.\nGrabs Pull Very similar to the pulling grab, put your hands up as quick as possible, get up and move together with the attacker. His hands are busy pulling you and his head unprotected. Just attack his head repeatedly.\nPush Again similar to the pushing grab, lock down his arms by pushing his elbows up, kick his groing with the front leg. Put the hand up, get up and keep attacking.\nPunches and Kicks Punches For punches, it is possible to use the already know deflections such as slap and salute. The only difference is the ability to get up right after the deflection is succeded in order to counter attack quickly.\nKicks Not Grounded chair If the chair is not grounded, you can use the regular defences for kicks such as horse kick and low earth. Horse kicks are preferred though, since it will stop the attacker before the kicks gets too close. But both techniques are effective.\nGrounded chair With a grounded chair is possible to put the hands on the handles. Then push the handles down, so that will make you up and kick forward. That might be a good defence when an attacker is trying to reach you but it is not too close yet.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " There are two type of arm grabs: Under the arms or Over the arms.\nUnder the arms Front When an attacker comes from the front and grabs you under the arms the defence is simple. Your hands are free and his head does not have any protection. An easy way to get rid of the attacker without too much pain or violence is just use open hand. Rather than do a strike, though, just push the attacker chin forward and walk in his direction. If the situation demands a more aggressive reaction, use any quick technique to strike the attacker\u0026rsquo;s head. Snake, straight punches and fire elbows are good examples.\nBack When an attacker comes from the back, the technique is quite different. First, step backwards into the attacker\u0026rsquo;s center line, then quickly do three earth elbows in sequence aiming to the head. The first one should be very quick and used as a distraction. The other two don\u0026rsquo;t need to be as quick, but they need to have more weight so they can be a powerful attack. Then use the sparrow hawk turn to face the attacker (possibly using an earth block) and keep the momentum by continuing attacking.\nOver the arms Front In this scenario, the attacker has his groin unprotected. The only sensible thing to do, given your arms are lock down, is to put both first together (but not locked down) and move up and straight to hit his groin. Don\u0026rsquo;t stop there, though. Keep going up, so in case the attacker releases you after the strike, your hands are in position to keeping attacking.\nBack This technique is hard, because it requires to remain relaxed (which is hard when somebody is grabbing you). With knees unlocked, step backwards into the attacker\u0026rsquo;s center line, move the hip quickly into his dantian while getting the hands up. If done correctly this should create a small gap between the attacker and yourself. Using your fist, hit backwards aiming for the attacker\u0026rsquo;s groin. Move the front leg next to the back leg and then hit the attacker\u0026rsquo;s groing again while stepping backwards into his direction. Do it 3 times, then use sparrow hawk turn to face the attacker and keep the momentum going by using different combinations.\n"

This will get your hands free and in position do a quick counter attack.\nUnder Very similar from the previous one. But here the fingers point down, the hands go down instead of up and the movement needs to finish with percussion to add extra power. Knees unlocked as before and body weight going down as well. This will get your hands free but also not in position to attack or defend easily. First thing, after getting the hands free is to put them up in order to defende against extra attack or to counter attack quickly.\n"

This one needs to be careful to not hit upwards.\nWood It is an elbow to be used when an attacker is coming from behind and is aiming at the dantian. Wood elbows are quite powerful and the main reason is because it needs to be done in a very straight move. It needs to turn the upper body a bit in order to hit the dantian, but be careful to don\u0026rsquo;t turn that much.\nEarth Backwards Elbow As a wood elbow, this one is also a movement to use when an attacker is coming from behind. Instead, it is used to hit the head rather than the dantian. It is important to turn the head and look at the attacker before use this elbow. This elbow is used as a low to high technique, in the sense, the elbows start at the low level and goes high up to the head to the attacker.\nSide Elbow This is also an earth elbow. But this is to use when an attacker is on the side. It is useful in combination with Fire Elbow, after the Fire Elbow, just move your upper body a bit to the side and hit the attacker again.\nMetal This is a high to low technique.

It is a good defence against round punches, in the sense, when done correctly it gives the defender a tactical advantage by stopping the attack early while enabling a quick couter attack.\nStrike Dao Shous can also be used as a strike, aiming for the throat or neck.

It\u0026rsquo;s important to notice it\u0026rsquo;s a kick and not a push and needs percussion and momentum. Specially important to bend the knee from the leg on the ground for maximum power. Hands in form a fist when kicking.\nCombinations Horse kick is usually used in combinations, since they are a bit more slow than punches. They\u0026rsquo;re perfect for when the target is not protecting their knee or to use as quick kick after a deflection like earth block.\n"

The technique, when applied correctly, uses the palm of the hand to cause damage.\nOpen Hand This technique is very similar to the straight punch technique. Both use body weight to strike as also bending the knees at the right moment. They are also very smilar on the soft then hard technique. The main difference, besides how the hand should be hit the target, is the open hand comes start from below to ends on the throat of the target.\nPossible targets This technique is most effective when landing on the throat.\nTips and tricks The most important thing is to use the body weight. It\u0026rsquo;s important to bend the knees at the right moment. Another good trick to remember, is the soft then hard part. It makes the punch really powerful and really quick, if done properly. Elbows need to be close to the ribs as well.\n"

	"content": " This is the basic punch technique, it starts from classroom stance.\nFist The hand needs to form a strong first. With fingers down and thumb close to the fingers.\nStraight Punch The important thing here is to understand one punch is driven by weight, not by strength. If strength is being used, it\u0026rsquo;s not internal martial anymore. To have a successful punch, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to drive the weight by using the knees. The knees are responsible to drive 2\u0026frasl;3 of the body weight. Also, a punch needs to be really quick. To accomplish that, a punch needs to be soft and then hard. When moving the arm, the punch is soft and when landing on the target then it becomes hard. It needs to have percussion as well on the very end of the punch for maximum power.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible to use both front and back arms to do a punch. The front punch is used most as a distraction and the back punch is where the power comes from.\nPossible targets The primary target is the throat, but it can be used in others places as well, like the groin.\nTips and tricks The most important thing is to use the body weight. It\u0026rsquo;s important to bend the knees at the right moment. Another good trick to remember, is the soft then hard part. It makes the punch really powerful and really quick, if done properly. Elbows need to be close to the ribs as well. Keep the other hand that\u0026rsquo;s not punching up all the times, so it\u0026rsquo;s possible to defend from a counter attack or punch again in a combinantion.\nMore info Shibo Nick explains in this video how a straight punch should be done.\n"

Then move the back leg forward. The knee needs to come above the dantian to protect the groin, so the movement should be circular rather than straight. Land the back leg 45 degrees forward of the front leg. Heels first and toes last. Now the front leg becomes the back leg and vice and versa.\nStepping back Move the front leg backwards.
